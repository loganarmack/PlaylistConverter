# Playlist Converter

This Python script will convert any Spotify Playlist into a Youtube Music Playlist.

You'll need to set the SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET environmental variables yourself.

You'll also need to create a headers_auth.json file. You can see instructions on how to do that [here](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html).

Then, just run `pipenv install` to get the required packages, and `pipenv run python main.py` to run the program.
